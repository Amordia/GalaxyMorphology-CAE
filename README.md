# Galaxy Morphology Classification using CAE

This repository contains the implementation of a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm for galaxy morphology classification using Convolutional AutoEncoders (CAE).

## Background

Galaxy morphology provides crucial insights into the history and evolution of galaxies. Automated classification of galaxy morphology is a challenging task due to the complexity and variability of galaxy shapes. This project employs Convolutional AutoEncoders (CAE) to address this challenge.

## Directory Structure

- `src/`: Contains the main source code for the CAE model, testing, and the deep neural network for classification.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook for visualizations related to the CAE model.
- `results/`: Visualization plots showcasing the performance of the model.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies.
4. Run the source code files in the order: `CAE.py`, `CAEtest.py`, `DNN.py`.

## Results

The results directory contains various plots that showcase the model's accuracy, loss, ROC curve, and confusion matrix.
